<h3>Policy</h3>
<ul>
  <br>
  <li>VT offers a 100% live and healthy delivery guarantee. Send clear photo evidence of any fish received dead on arrival to <a
      href="mailto:tyler.drake@vibranttropical.com">tyler.drake@vibranttropical.com.</a> Upon valid claim, a
    replacement will be redelivered in 24 hours.<br><br><span
      style="font-weight: bolder;"> Guarantee void if:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Photo is not taken of the fish in the bag it was delivered.</li>
      <li>Photo is not taken within 30 minutes of delivery.</li>
      <li>No person is present to receive the delivery and the fish are left unattended.</li>
      <li>Fish are not held at delivery address or with the keeper who placed the order.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li>VT does not accept livestock orders under $30.</li>
  <br>
  <li>VT cannot guarantee delivered fish will carry identical colors and patterns as in photographs. The photos
    represent best in show breeder parents and the genetic line your fish will come from. Fish are delivered as very
    young adults and will display their best color with proper care and maturity.</li>
    <br>
  <li>VT cannot be held liable for the transfer of any sickness or compatibility related issue to your fish.  The recomendation is to follow fishkeeping best practices and holding new fish in a quarantine tank for 4 weeks before integrating them with other fish.    </li>
  <br>
  <li>VT will only guarantee the sexing of the dimorpic fish when it is explicitly specified on the menu.  Sexing of monomophic fish can be stressful and an invasive procedure.  Instead, an attempt to sex off behavioural cues and will be made to fulfill a balanced order.  Ordering 6 monomophic fish gives over 98% chance of receiving both genders.  </li>
